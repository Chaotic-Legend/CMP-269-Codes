/**
 * A common task in programming is computing statistics for a set of numbers. A statistic is a numerical value that summarizes some aspect of a dataset. Some common statistics include the mean (or average) and the standard deviation, which indicates how spread out the data points are around the mean.
 * In this assignment, you will be creating a class called StatisticsCalculator.java that will performing different statistical computations.
 * To assist with this, I have created created this interface that will be implemented by your class StatisticsCalculator.java.
